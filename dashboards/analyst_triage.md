# Analyst Triage Workflow

## Objective

This document explains how SOC analysts use the dashboard to prioritize and investigate alerts efficiently.

---

## Step 1 — Start With Priority View

Analysts begin by reviewing alert counts by priority level.  
P1 alerts are investigated first, followed by P2 and P3.

---

## Step 2 — Review Detection Context

Using the detection rule breakdown, analysts determine which types of signals are most active and whether multiple detections contributed to high-priority alerts.

---

## Step 3 — Identify Affected Users

Alerts by user role highlight whether sensitive identities are being targeted, increasing urgency.

---

## Step 4 — Domain Investigation

The top risky domains panel provides pivot points for identifying potential phishing campaigns or malicious senders.

---

## Step 5 — Correlation Awareness

The priority vs detection rule matrix shows how multiple signals combine, helping analysts understand the confidence behind high-severity alerts.

---

## Outcome

This workflow ensures analysts move from **severity → context → exposure → source**, enabling efficient and structured investigations aligned with SOC best practices.
