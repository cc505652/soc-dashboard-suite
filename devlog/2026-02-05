## Phase
Phase 5 — SOC Dashboard Preparation (Day 12)

## Work Completed
- Generated aggregated datasets from prioritized alert stream for dashboard visualization
- Created dashboard-ready metrics including:
  - Alerts by priority (P1–P4 distribution)
  - Alerts over time (daily alert volume)
  - Alerts by detection rule (rule contribution analysis)
  - Alerts by user role (identity exposure trends)
  - Top risky sender domains (frequent alert sources)
  - Priority vs detection rule matrix (severity-rule relationship)
- Saved all dashboard datasets under `data/dashboard/`

## Key Decisions
- Used aggregated metrics instead of raw alerts to simulate real SOC monitoring dashboards
- Designed outputs to support operational visibility rather than deep forensic analysis
- Structured datasets to be tool-agnostic (usable in Streamlit, Power BI, or web dashboards)

## Alternatives Considered
- Visualizing directly inside notebooks → rejected (not portfolio-friendly)
- Building dashboard before aggregation → rejected (would mix logic with UI)
- Including raw alert logs in dashboard layer → rejected (too noisy and not SOC-realistic)

## Open Questions
- Which visualizations best demonstrate SOC effectiveness (trend vs severity vs identity)
- Whether to add SLA-style metrics (time-to-triage simulation) later
- How to simulate analyst workflow stages in dashboard

## Status
- Phase Progress: Dashboard data layer completed
- Repo Health: Stable with detection pipeline and dashboard-ready outputs
- Next Immediate Step: Build SOC dashboard UI to visualize detection performance
