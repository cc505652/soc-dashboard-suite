## Phase
Phase 2 — Analyst Investigation Workflow (Step 6)

## Work Completed
- Built investigation-ready incident summaries from SOC incident dataset
- Implemented severity classification based on correlated alerts and alert volume
- Generated human-readable investigation narratives for SOC analysts
- Added recommended response actions aligned with incident severity
- Produced structured investigation view dataset for dashboard consumption

## Key Decisions
- Treated correlated signals as highest risk indicators
- Modeled investigation summaries as analyst-facing context rather than raw metrics
- Linked response guidance directly to severity classification
- Kept investigation logic separate from detection and incident modeling layers

## Why This Matters
This step introduces the human operational layer of the SOC. It bridges automated detection with analyst decision-making, which is a core component of real-world security operations platforms.

## Alternatives Considered
- Leaving incidents as raw grouped alerts → rejected (not SOC-realistic)
- Using only numeric scoring → added narrative summaries for analyst usability
- Embedding response logic inside detections → kept playbook-style recommendations separate

## Status
- Phase Progress: Analyst investigation workflow implemented
- System Capability: End-to-end SOC pipeline from telemetry to analyst-ready cases
- Next Immediate Step: Executive and SOC metrics dashboard layer
