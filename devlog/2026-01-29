## Phase
Phase 3 — Context & Baselining (Day 5)

## Work Completed
- Introduced identity-level context into email telemetry
- Derived normalized `recipient_user` identifiers from recipient_email
- Simulated enterprise-style user role distribution (normal / admin / executive)
- Assigned role labels consistently per user
- Computed per-user email volume baselines
- Classified users into volume bands (low / medium / high volume)
- Saved enriched dataset with identity context to `data/enriched/email_with_identity_context.csv`

## Key Decisions
- Used recipient identity as primary entity for email-based behavioral modeling
- Simulated role distribution rather than hardcoding specific individuals
- Modeled identity context as a risk modifier, not a detection trigger
- Treated user volume as behavioral baseline rather than anomaly detection at this stage

## Alternatives Considered
- Manual role assignment for specific Enron users → rejected (not scalable or realistic)
- Using sender identity instead of recipient → deferred (recipient risk is more relevant for phishing scenarios)
- Creating anomaly scores immediately → rejected (requires temporal context first)

## Open Questions
- Whether to later model sender-recipient relationship frequency
- How to incorporate identity privilege into severity scoring logic
- Whether to differentiate shared mailboxes vs personal mailboxes

## Status
- Phase Progress: Day 5 Completed
- Repo Health: Stable with identity context layer added
- Next Immediate Step: Day 6 — Temporal baselining (business hours and time-of-day behavior)
