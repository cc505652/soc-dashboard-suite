# Dev Log — 2026-01-25

## Phase
Phase 1 — Foundation & Schema

## Work Completed
- Created full SOC Dashboard Suite repository structure
- Added SOC-aligned README defining scope, philosophy, and system intent
- Defined normalized schemas for:
  - Email telemetry
  - Authentication telemetry
  - Unified SOC event abstraction
- Added architecture, detection, alerting, dashboards, playbooks, and cloud-mapping directories
- Introduced development log (devlog/) for tracking engineering decisions
- Fixed data directory naming inconsistency (normalized)

## Key Decisions
- Chose schema-first design to enforce evidence contracts before ingestion
- Explicitly excluded email body inspection to avoid payload-level noise and complexity
- Treated authentication events as behavioral signals rather than identity facts
- Made alert explainability and investigation context first-class schema fields
- Separated system artifacts from development logs to avoid repository clutter

## Alternatives Considered
- Starting directly with ingestion notebooks → rejected (risk of schema drift and refactors)
- Building dashboards before detections → rejected (dashboards must reflect alert reality)
- Introducing ML early → rejected (detection reliability and SOC constraints not yet established)

## Open Questions
- Whether attachment hashes should be promoted to first-class entities
- How aggressively to baseline rare sender domains without inflating false positives
- Whether to model device trust as static or adaptive context in early phases

## Status
- Phase Progress: Completed
- Repo Health: Clean and stable
- Next Immediate Step: Phase 2 — Email ingestion and normalization (Python notebooks)
