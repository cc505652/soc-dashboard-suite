## Phase
Phase 2 — Incident Modeling (Step 5)

## Work Completed
- Unified alerts from email, authentication, and cross-signal correlation layers
- Standardized timestamps across all alert sources
- Implemented SOC-style rolling investigation window (14 days)
- Added per-user alert caps to simulate pipeline safety controls
- Optimized incident grouping using a sliding time window algorithm
- Generated structured incident dataset representing grouped SOC investigations

## Key Decisions
- Modeled incidents as time-bound clusters of alerts per user
- Applied realistic operational constraints to maintain system performance
- Replaced brute-force grouping with efficient linear traversal logic
- Preserved modular separation between detection and incident layers

## Why This Matters
This step transitions the system from alert generation to SOC investigation modeling. It reflects how security operations teams handle alert volume by grouping related signals into actionable incidents.

## Alternatives Considered
- Processing full historical alert dataset → rejected (not SOC-realistic)
- Using fixed alert count thresholds → time-based grouping chosen for realism
- Ignoring performance constraints → added operational guardrails instead

## Status
- Phase Progress: Incident modeling layer implemented
- System Capability: End-to-end SOC pipeline from telemetry to incidents
- Next Immediate Step: Analyst investigation workflow modeling
