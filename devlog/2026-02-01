## Phase
Phase 4 — Detection Engineering (Day 8)

## Work Completed
- Implemented Detection 02: High-Risk Email Timing
- Detection logic identifies emails sent to privileged users (admin/executive)
  during off-hours or unusual activity times
- Combined identity context with temporal behavioral modeling
- Generated alert dataset and saved to `alerts_high_risk_timing.csv`
- Maintained separation between detection logic and upstream enrichment layers

## Key Decisions
- Treated identity sensitivity as primary risk driver
- Modeled unusual timing as contextual signal rather than standalone anomaly
- Assigned high severity to all alerts due to privileged user exposure
- Avoided introducing domain or frequency logic into this detection

## Alternatives Considered
- Restricting detection to external senders → deferred for tuning stage
- Requiring domain rarity in addition to time anomaly → deferred (multi-signal rule)
- Using statistical anomaly scoring → rejected (favor explainable logic)

## Open Questions
- How this detection should be correlated with suspicious sender domain alerts
- Whether to suppress alerts for users with globally distributed work schedules

## Status
- Phase Progress: Two detections implemented
- Repo Health: Stable with layered, explainable detection rules
- Next Immediate Step: Detection 03 — Multi-signal correlation rule
