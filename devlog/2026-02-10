## Phase
Phase 2 — Multi-Source Correlation (Step 4)

## Work Completed
- Implemented cross-signal correlation between email threat alerts and authentication anomaly alerts
- Standardized timestamps to resolve timezone mismatches across telemetry sources
- Built identity resolution layer mapping email identities to internal user IDs
- Injected controlled test login anomalies to validate correlation logic
- Successfully generated cross-signal alerts representing potential post-phishing compromise scenarios

## Key Decisions
- Used identity directory mapping to enable cross-system correlation
- Maintained time-window-based correlation logic to simulate real SOC workflows
- Validated pipeline using controlled signal injection rather than relaxing detection thresholds

## Why This Matters
This step enables detection of multi-stage attacks, specifically phishing followed by suspicious account activity. It elevates the system from single-event detection to attack chain identification, which is a key capability of modern SOC platforms.

## Alternatives Considered
- Broadening time window to force matches → rejected (would reduce realism)
- Correlating all email alerts → limited to high-priority alerts to maintain signal quality
- Ignoring identity mismatches → implemented proper identity resolution instead

## Status
- Phase Progress: Cross-signal detection validated
- Repo Health: Stable multi-source SOC detection pipeline
- Next Immediate Step: Incident modeling and alert grouping
