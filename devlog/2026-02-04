## Phase
Phase 4 — Detection Engineering (Day 11)

## Work Completed
- Implemented alert scoring model for correlated alerts
- Assigned base risk scores from severity levels
- Increased risk score based on:
  - number of triggered detection rules
  - off-hours activity
  - rare domain status
  - first-seen domain indicator
- Capped risk score to maintain bounded scale
- Translated risk scores into SOC-style priority levels (P1–P4)
- Generated prioritized alert queue

## Key Decisions
- Modeled prioritization as additive risk factors for explainability
- Treated multi-signal detections as higher risk rather than separate rules
- Ensured scoring remains interpretable rather than statistical black-box

## Alternatives Considered
- Using machine learning for scoring → rejected (reduces explainability)
- Weighting time behavior more heavily → deferred for tuning phase
- Using percentile-based scoring → rejected (dataset-dependent)

## Open Questions
- Whether priority thresholds should be tuned for alert volume constraints
- How analyst feedback could later be used to adjust scoring weights

## Status
- Phase Progress: Alert prioritization implemented
- Repo Health: Stable with SOC-style alert queue ready
- Next Immediate Step: SOC dashboard design and visualization layer
