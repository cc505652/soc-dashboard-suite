## Phase
Phase 2 — Identity Threat Detection (Step 3)

## Work Completed
- Implemented authentication anomaly detections using enriched identity context
- Built detection logic for:
  - Unusual login times for privileged users
  - Logins from previously unseen countries
  - Successful login following recent failed attempt
- Combined identity anomaly detections into unified authentication alert dataset
- Structured alert outputs with detection ID, severity, and analyst-readable reason
- Prepared identity alerts for future cross-signal correlation with email detections

## Key Decisions
- Used explainable rule-based detection rather than opaque anomaly models
- Prioritized identity risk signals relevant to account compromise scenarios
- Maintained separation between enrichment logic and detection logic
- Treated synthetic authentication telemetry as a stand-in for real enterprise logs

## Why This Matters
This step expands the SOC system from email-based threat detection to identity security monitoring. It enables modeling of account compromise behavior and prepares the system for cross-correlation between phishing activity and suspicious login events.

## Alternatives Considered
- Using complex statistical anomaly scoring → rejected (reduced interpretability)
- Implementing real-time streaming detections → deferred to later system phase
- Adding device fingerprint anomaly detection → postponed for scope control

## Status
- Phase Progress: Identity anomaly detections implemented
- Repo Health: Stable with dual-source detection (email + authentication)
- Next Immediate Step: Cross-signal correlation between email and login alerts
