### 📅 **Dev Log — 14 Feb 2026**

**Phase:** Real-Time SOC Pipeline (Phase 3)
**Focus Area:** Live Stream → Enrichment → Detection Integration

---

#### ✅ Work Completed

* Successfully initialized and ran the **real-time event stream simulator** to emulate live ingestion of ~495K email telemetry events.
* Debugged CSV stream writing behavior to ensure consistent schema availability across consumer notebooks.
* Implemented header initialization for enriched event stream to prevent downstream schema mismatch during real-time reads.
* Fixed path misalignment between:

  * raw stream output (`email_event_stream.csv`)
  * enriched stream output (`email_event_stream_enriched.csv`)
  * detection input source
* Corrected datetime parsing issues in enrichment loop to safely process partially written stream rows.
* Established consistent polling-based enrichment logic for:

  * sender domain extraction
  * first-seen timestamp calculation
  * day-level novelty detection (`is_first_seen_day`)
* Connected detection engine to enriched telemetry stream (instead of raw simulator output).
* Verified end-to-end pipeline functionality:

  * Simulator actively streaming events
  * Enrichment incrementally processing contextual signals
  * Detection consuming enriched events and generating alert candidates

---

#### 📊 Runtime Observations

* Enrichment processing live events incrementally (1000+ events processed)
* Detection engine polling enriched stream successfully (900+ events processed)
* Detection lag behind enrichment observed as expected due to file-based polling interval (~2s)
* Alert stream file (`email_detection_stream.csv`) being populated during runtime

---

#### 📌 Status

Real-time telemetry ingestion → contextual enrichment → rule-based detection pipeline is operational on simulated live email traffic.

Detection logic is now executing on enriched context rather than raw telemetry.

Phase 3 pipeline chaining validated under live stream conditions.
