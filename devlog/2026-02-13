## Phase
Phase 2 — Executive Metrics Layer (Step 7)

## Work Completed
- Generated SOC incident volume metrics by severity level
- Computed average incident duration across severity classes
- Calculated critical incident rate as a threat posture indicator
- Counted unique users impacted by active incidents
- Built daily incident trend dataset for temporal analysis
- Saved dashboard-ready SOC metrics outputs

## Key Decisions
- Derived duration from investigation window timestamps
- Treated incident severity as a proxy for organizational risk exposure
- Aggregated trends by day to enable executive-level reporting
- Maintained separation between operational incidents and reporting layer

## Why This Matters
This step enables leadership-level visibility into SOC effectiveness and threat posture. It allows stakeholders to monitor incident growth, critical risk exposure, and user impact over time.

## Alternatives Considered
- Alert-level reporting → incident-level aggregation chosen for clarity
- Raw time series → daily aggregation improves interpretability
- Embedding metrics inside dashboard code → kept as standalone dataset

## Status
- Phase Progress: SOC metrics layer implemented
- System Capability: End-to-end detection + investigation + reporting pipeline
- Next Immediate Step: Real-time ingestion and dashboard integration
