# Dev Log — 2026-01-30

## Phase
Phase 3 — Context & Baselining (Day 6)

## Work Completed
- Derived temporal features from email event timestamps
  - hour of day
  - day of week
- Implemented business-hours classification (weekday + 08:00–18:00 window)
- Modeled per-user typical active hour using modal hour
- Computed deviation between actual hour and user baseline hour
- Classified temporal behavior into:
  - normal_time
  - off_hours
  - unusual_hour
- Saved enriched dataset with temporal context to `data/enriched/email_with_temporal_context.csv`

## Key Decisions
- Modeled time context as behavioral metadata rather than anomaly detection
- Used modal hour to preserve dominant user behavior patterns
- Treated business-hours violations as contextual risk modifiers, not alerts

## Alternatives Considered
- Using mean/median hour → rejected (less robust to multimodal patterns)
- Immediate anomaly scoring → rejected (requires multi-context correlation first)
- Hard-coded per-user schedules → rejected (not scalable or realistic)

## Open Questions
- Whether to later incorporate seasonal or monthly behavior patterns
- How strongly temporal deviation should influence alert severity

## Status
- Phase Progress: Phase 3 Completed (Core context layers established)
- Repo Health: Stable with multi-dimensional behavioral context
- Next Immediate Step: Phase 4 — Begin detection engineering
