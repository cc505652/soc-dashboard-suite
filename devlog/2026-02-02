## Phase
Phase 4 — Detection Engineering (Day 9)

## Work Completed
- Implemented Detection 03: Multi-Signal Email Risk
- Detection logic correlates:
  - Rare or first-seen sender domains
  - Off-hours or unusual timing
  - Privileged recipient roles
  - External sender condition
- Generated high-confidence alert dataset and saved to `alerts_multi_signal_email_risk.csv`
- Maintained strict separation between detection logic and enrichment layers

## Key Decisions
- Required all contextual signals to align to minimize false positives
- Treated this rule as high-confidence and assigned critical severity
- Modeled detection as explainable correlation rather than statistical anomaly

## Alternatives Considered
- Allowing detection to trigger on any two signals → rejected (too noisy)
- Using scoring instead of boolean logic → deferred to future enhancement
- Including user volume anomaly as additional signal → deferred

## Open Questions
- How this rule should be deduplicated with earlier detections
- Whether domain reputation or URL signals should later augment this rule

## Status
- Phase Progress: Three detections implemented
- Repo Health: Stable with layered and correlated detection logic
- Next Immediate Step: Alert correlation and deduplication across detections
