## Phase
Phase 2 — Multi-Source Telemetry Expansion (Step 1)

## Work Completed
- Extended SOC system design to support authentication telemetry alongside email events
- Defined a normalized schema for authentication/login events
- Created ingestion pipeline notebook for authentication telemetry
- Established directory structure for raw and normalized authentication data
- Aligned authentication schema with existing unified SOC event design

## Key Decisions
- Treated authentication logs as a second core telemetry source
- Designed schema to prioritize identity, location, and login outcome fields
- Maintained separation between ingestion, enrichment, and detection layers
- Deferred detection logic until identity baselining is implemented

## Why This Matters
Adding authentication telemetry shifts the project from a single-source email detection system to a multi-source SOC monitoring platform. This enables future cross-signal detections such as login anomalies, credential compromise, and post-phishing activity.

## Alternatives Considered
- Adding detections immediately → rejected (identity context must be built first)
- Using complex real-time streaming → deferred to later phase
- Expanding to endpoint telemetry at this stage → postponed to maintain focus

## Status
- Phase Progress: Authentication telemetry foundation established
- Repo Health: Stable, with structured expansion into identity security
- Next Immediate Step: Build identity baselines and login behavior context
