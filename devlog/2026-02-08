## Phase
Phase 2 — Identity Context Modeling (Step 2)

## Work Completed
- Generated synthetic authentication telemetry for SOC pipeline testing
- Normalized login events into unified SOC schema
- Built user behavioral baselines for login hour activity
- Flagged unusual login times based on deviation from user baseline
- Added first-seen country tracking for login location novelty
- Created failed login indicator for future brute force and compromise detections
- Saved enriched authentication dataset for detection phase

## Key Decisions
- Used explainable statistical baselines instead of black-box anomaly models
- Modeled identity behavior as context enrichment rather than detection output
- Kept enrichment layer separate from detection logic to preserve modular pipeline design

## Why This Matters
This step transforms raw login telemetry into behavioral identity signals. These signals enable future detection of compromised accounts, suspicious access patterns, and cross-correlation with phishing activity.

## Alternatives Considered
- Using complex ML anomaly detection → rejected (reduced interpretability)
- Adding device fingerprint baselines → deferred to later enhancement phase
- Modeling per-IP reputation → postponed to keep identity modeling focused

## Status
- Phase Progress: Identity behavioral context layer implemented
- Repo Health: Stable with multi-source SOC telemetry (email + authentication)
- Next Immediate Step: Implement login anomaly detections
