# Dev Log — 2026-01-27

## Phase
Phase 2 — Ingestion & Normalization (Day 2)

## Work Completed
- Added ingestion validation checks to email ingestion pipeline
- Measured header completeness across parsed emails
- Verified presence/absence rates for:
  - sender_email
  - recipient_email
  - subject
  - event_time
- Inspected domain extraction quality for sender and recipient
- Measured potential duplicate events (no removal performed)
- Generated rejection summary statistics (initial vs valid vs dropped)

## Key Decisions
- Treated ingestion as structural validation, not behavioral cleaning
- Chose to observe duplicates rather than remove them (duplicates may represent campaign patterns)
- Accepted moderate header noise rather than imputing or guessing missing fields
- Maintained strict boundary between ingestion logic and enrichment/detection logic

## Alternatives Considered
- Deduplicating emails during ingestion → rejected (may erase attack campaign signals)
- Filling missing subjects with placeholders → rejected (would hide evidence gaps)
- Filtering "internal-only" emails → rejected (biases baseline behavior)

## Open Questions
- Whether to extract sender display names in future for impersonation detection
- How to model multi-recipient emails during correlation stages
- Whether attachment metadata should be parsed from MIME structure later

## Status
- Phase Progress: Phase 2 Completed (Email Ingestion Stable)
- Repo Health: Clean, structured, and logically layered
- Next Immediate Step: Phase 3 — Begin context baselining (domain frequency modeling)
