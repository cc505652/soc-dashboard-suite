### 📅 **Dev Log — 15 Feb 2026**

**Phase:** Real-Time SOC Pipeline (Phase 3)
**Focus Area:** Alert Streaming → Live Incident Correlation

---

#### ✅ Work Completed

* Diagnosed schema collapse issue in `email_event_stream.csv` caused by unsafe CSV append operations during live simulation.
* Reconfigured simulator write logic using explicit quoting and escape characters to preserve column integrity under streaming conditions.
* Validated proper multi-column structure across:

  * `email_event_stream.csv`
  * `email_event_stream_enriched.csv`
  * `email_detection_stream.csv`
* Aligned detection engine to consume **enriched telemetry stream** instead of raw ingestion feed.
* Implemented field mapping layer within detection loop to normalize alert schema for incident builder input:

  * `event_time`
  * `user_id` (mapped from `recipient_email`)
  * `alert_source`
  * `severity`
* Resolved downstream incident builder blocking due to missing detection schema fields (e.g., `sender_domain` dependency).
* Verified alert stream generation under live conditions (~9K+ processed detection events).
* Established live alert ingestion compatibility for incident modeling pipeline.
* Activated real-time incident builder to cluster alerts into correlated 48-hour user-level windows.
* Confirmed incremental incident generation from live alert stream:

  * Incident builder consuming detection output continuously
  * ~1900+ alerts processed into incident candidates

#### 📊 Runtime Observations

* Detection engine maintaining steady ingestion from enriched stream (9K+ processed events).
* Incident builder actively clustering alerts into correlated timelines.
* Incident creation progressing incrementally with alert stream growth.
* File-based stream lag observed across pipeline layers due to polling intervals (2–3s), within expected tolerance.
* No schema mismatch or datetime parsing failures observed post-stream write correction.

#### 📌 Status

Real-time pipeline now supports:

**Simulated Telemetry → Contextual Enrichment → Alert Detection → Live Incident Modeling**

Streaming alerts are being successfully converted into user-scoped incident timelines under live ingestion conditions.

Phase 3 incident correlation layer operational on streaming detection output.
