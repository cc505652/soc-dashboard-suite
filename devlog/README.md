# Development Log

This directory records daily engineering decisions, tradeoffs, and design adjustments
made during the development of the SOC Dashboard Suite.

The purpose is to:
- document why decisions were made
- capture rejected alternatives
- preserve architectural intent over time

Logs focus on reasoning, not task lists.
