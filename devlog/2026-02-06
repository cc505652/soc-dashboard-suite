## Phase
Phase 5 — SOC Dashboard UI (Day 13)

## Work Completed
- Built Streamlit-based SOC dashboard interface
- Integrated dashboard with aggregated SOC metrics generated in Phase 5 Day 12
- Implemented visual panels for:
  - Alerts by priority
  - Alerts over time
  - Alerts by detection rule
  - Alerts by user role
  - Top risky sender domains
  - Priority vs detection rule correlation matrix
- Verified dashboard renders correctly with local pipeline outputs

## Key Decisions
- Separated visualization layer from detection and analytics logic
- Designed dashboard to reflect SOC monitoring priorities rather than generic charts
- Focused on operational interpretability over visual complexity

## Alternatives Considered
- Building dashboard inside notebooks → rejected (not portfolio or SOC realistic)
- Using raw alerts instead of aggregates → rejected (too noisy, not analyst-friendly)
- Adding filtering controls immediately → deferred to enhancement phase

## Open Questions
- Whether to add interactive filters (date range, priority)
- How to simulate analyst workflow or investigation drill-down
- Whether to include SLA or response-time simulation metrics

## Status
- Phase Progress: SOC dashboard interface complete
- Repo Health: Stable with full pipeline from ingestion → detection → dashboard
- Next Immediate Step: Final project polish and portfolio presentation prep
