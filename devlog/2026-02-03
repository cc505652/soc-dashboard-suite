## Phase
Phase 4 — Detection Engineering (Day 10)

## Work Completed
- Implemented alert correlation pipeline to combine alerts from multiple detections
- Merged outputs from:
  - Suspicious Sender Domain
  - High-Risk Email Timing
  - Multi-Signal Email Risk
- Created deduplication key based on event_time + sender + recipient
- Applied severity-aware deduplication to retain highest-priority alert per event
- Aggregated triggered detection rules into a single field for analyst context
- Generated unified correlated alert dataset

## Key Decisions
- Treated alert correlation as a pipeline component rather than a detection rule
- Used deterministic deduplication keys for reproducibility
- Preserved multi-rule trigger information for analyst triage
- Prioritized alerts using severity rather than arbitrary ordering

## Alternatives Considered
- Keeping duplicate alerts for each rule → rejected (analyst overload)
- Using probabilistic scoring for deduplication → rejected (reduced explainability)
- Merging detection logic earlier in pipeline → rejected (breaks modular design)

## Open Questions
- How correlated alerts should later be scored and prioritized
- Whether alert frequency per user should influence prioritization
- How cross-event correlation (campaign detection) could be modeled

## Status
- Phase Progress: Alert correlation pipeline implemented
- Repo Health: Stable with unified SOC-style alert stream
- Next Immediate Step: Alert scoring and prioritization
